# /code-review-fix: Fix Code Review Issues

## Philosophy (Why this exists)

A code review is only useful when its findings get turned into real, verified fixes. This command takes the output of `/code-review`, or a clearly described manual issue, fixes only the stated problems one at a time — proves each fix with the narrowest relevant test — and then runs the project's validate command so the whole codebase is checked once everything is done.

## Invocation & Arguments (INPUT)

**Usage examples**

- `/code-review-fix .agents/reports/review/code-review-2026-04-30-143000.md`
- `/code-review-fix .agents/reports/review/code-review-2026-04-30-143000.md src/auth`
- `/code-review-fix "I ran the app manually and noticed none of the tools are working. Please fix it."`
- `/code-review-fix "Login accepts expired tokens" src/auth`

**Arguments received**

- Positional: `$1`, `$2`

**Arguments policy**

- **Mandatory**: `$1` is required. `$2` is optional.

**Argument contract**

- Required args: `$1` = a code review report file path OR a free-form description of the issue(s) to fix
- Optional args: `$2` = scope limiter, such as a directory, file path, feature area, or list of issue numbers to focus on
- Defaults: When `$2` is omitted, address every actionable issue from `$1`
- Validation rules:
  - If `$1` looks like a file path, the file must exist and be readable; read it in full before planning fixes.
  - If `$1` looks like a file path but the file does not exist, stop and ask for the correct path.
  - If `$1` is not a file path, treat it as a manual issue description.
  - If `$2` is provided, do not edit code outside that scope unless an issue cannot be fixed safely without doing so; ask before expanding scope.
  - Do not invent issues that are not in `$1`.

**If arguments are missing/invalid**

- If `$1` is missing, stop and ask for a code review file path or an issue description.
- If `$1` is a description but is too vague to map to files or expected behavior, stop and ask for the missing details.
- If the requested scope in `$2` conflicts with the issues in `$1`, stop and ask which source should control.

## Context to Load (INPUT)

**Read these files (auto-load into context)**

- The code review report at `$1` when `$1` is an existing file path
- `.claude/commands/validate/validate.md` when it exists, for final validation instructions

**Capture live state**

!`git status --short`
!`git diff --name-only`

## Process (PROCESS)

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Resolve the review input.**
   - If `$1` is an existing file, read it in full before extracting issues.
   - If `$1` is not a file, treat it as a manual issue description and record it verbatim as the source of truth for fixes.
   - If the input is a code review report that says no issues were found, do not change any code and proceed to Step 8 with `Status: Success`.

2. **Establish the worktree baseline.**
   - Run `git status --short` and `git diff --name-only`.
   - Identify files already changed before this command starts.
   - Preserve those unrelated changes; do not revert, overwrite, stage, commit, push, or merge them.

3. **Extract actionable issues.**
   - Convert the review input into a numbered issue list.
   - For each issue, capture the severity (when given), file path, line number, what is wrong, the expected behavior, and any suggested fix from the report.
   - Ignore review notes that are not concrete defects or requested fixes.
   - If `$2` is provided, drop any issues outside that scope from the list.
   - If an issue cannot be mapped to real code after reading the relevant files, stop and ask for clarification before editing.

4. **Plan each fix before touching code.**
   - Read each affected file in full.
   - Read nearby tests, imports, exports, data contracts, and call sites needed to understand the issue.
   - Decide the smallest coherent change that resolves the issue.
   - Decide the targeted test or verification command that will prove the fix before editing.
   - Order the fixes so prerequisite or shared-code fixes happen before dependent ones.

5. **Apply each fix one by one.**
   - Implement only the code changes needed for the current issue.
   - For each fix, in order:
     1. Explain what was wrong (reference file path and line numbers).
     2. Make the edit.
     3. Add or update a relevant test when the repository has a suitable test setup.
     4. Run the targeted test or verification command chosen in Step 4 and record the result.
   - Keep existing style, naming, and framework patterns.
   - Do not introduce new dependencies unless the issue cannot be fixed safely without one; ask before adding a dependency.
   - If a targeted test fails, fix the implementation or the test and re-run until it passes or a real blocker is identified.
   - If one issue is blocked but later issues are independent, continue with the independent issues and report the blocker.

6. **Run final validation.**
   - If `.claude/commands/validate/validate.md` exists, follow that command after all attempted fixes.
   - If no validate command exists, run the broadest safe project-local validation available (test command, lint, type check) based on package scripts or documented commands.
   - If no safe validation command can be identified, report that final validation could not be run and explain what is missing.
   - If final validation fails, fix failures introduced by this command and re-run; if a failure is unrelated or cannot be fixed safely, set `Status: Partial` and document it.

7. **Inspect the final diff.**
   - Run `git status --short` and review the files this command changed.
   - Confirm every changed file is tied to a fixed issue, an added/updated test, or a validation requirement.
   - If an unexpected file changed, inspect it and either explain why it was required or stop and ask how to proceed.

8. **Return the completion report.**
   - Use the **Human-Readable Report** format below.
   - Include the original issue numbers from the review report when available.
   - For each fixed issue, explain what was wrong, show the fix with file references and a concise code or diff summary, and list the test command that verified it.
   - List any issues that were intentionally not fixed and explain why (e.g., already resolved, not a real defect, deferred per documentation).

**Decision discipline**

- If you must make assumptions: list them explicitly and keep them minimal.
- If blocked by missing info: stop and ask targeted questions.
- If a review finding is plausible but no longer matches the current code, do not change code; explain the mismatch in the report.

**Quality/Safety constraints**

- Fix only the issues from `$1`, narrowed by `$2` when present.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Do not stage files, commit, push, or merge.
- Do not perform broad refactors, formatting-only sweeps, or opportunistic cleanups outside the listed issues.
- Do not skip targeted tests for fixed issues unless no test harness exists or the issue is not testable in this repository.
- Do not mark the task complete unless each attempted fix has a test result, validation result, or documented blocker.

## Output (OUTPUT)

### Human-Readable Report (for humans)

Return a concise, easy-to-scan summary in plain language at a 16-year-old reading level:

- **Status**: Success | Partial | Blocked
- **Review input**: file path or manual issue description used as the source of fixes
- **Scope**: scope applied from `$2`, or `Full review input`
- **Issues fixed**: for each issue, list:
  - Issue number (from the report when available)
  - What was wrong (with file path and line)
  - What changed (file references and a short summary of the fix)
  - Test command that verified it and pass/fail result
- **Issues not fixed**: any issues skipped or deferred and the detailed reason (e.g., already resolved, not a real defect, deferred per documentation, blocker)
- **Final validation**: validation command used and pass/fail/not-run result
- **Files changed**: files modified or created by this command
- **Assumptions**: explicit assumptions made during the run
- **Risks / gotchas**: only real remaining risks or test gaps
- **Next steps**: follow-up actions needed before commit

## Notes

- This command is designed to consume the report produced by `/code-review`, but it also accepts a clearly described manual issue when the user has spotted a problem during testing.
- Final validation should be a single comprehensive sweep over the codebase so the user knows the fixes did not break anything else.
